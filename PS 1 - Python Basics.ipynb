The knight is sneaking towards the camp when a howling tears the silent night behind him. The watching bandit looks towards the scream and spot the crouching knight. Before the bandit had the time to alert the camp, the knight rushed fiercely towards him. In the hurry, the bandit nocks and fires hastily an arrow at the knight. The knight's armor is heavy, preventing him to dodge properly or to raise his shield on time. The arrow hits the left leg of the knight. Although the armor absorbs part of the shock, the knight stumbles. He drops his shield right away, reaches the bandit before he shots another arrow and slices him with his two-handed sword. The bandit drops dead and the two others draw their swords simultaneously. The knight steps backward to get his shield back but the howling is resonating again. The knight looks back and spots a massive human form wearing giangantic warhammer... It's Ziraxas the Dreadful, a well-known and ruthless bandit. Even facing a hopeless situation, a knight's duty is to protect the realm of Cindora. The knight is preparing for his final fight when a hissing sound rings above them. The sky darkens and gray clouds stack above the two other bandits. Suddenly a bright light blinds them all and strikes the two bandits, leaving charred corpses.

    "*Hint*: each class contains an attribute for name, health and damage. Name, health and damage must be in the constructor of the class for better flexibility. Each class contains at least one method: \"take_damage\" which removes some damage from the health attributes and check if the character is dead or not. "
